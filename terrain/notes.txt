smooth normals function
size = x + 1, y + 1

1) create a biarray with a size of (size.x + 2) and (size.y + 2) which store positions
2) create and array of triangles out of those positions and calculate triangles normals  
3) create and biarray of Vertex with a size of size, which contain only needed vertices and then calculate in there the smooth normals using the normals array
4) create textures coordinates by dividing the chunk by its size 


notes : 
- heightmap generator is really not optimized 

- goes through the center of a biarray like this :

	for (size_t i = 0; i < size.x; i++)
	{
		for (size_t j = 0; j < size.y; j++)
		{
			positions.value(i + 1, j + 1).y = TWO_DIM(i, j, size.x);
		}
	}
